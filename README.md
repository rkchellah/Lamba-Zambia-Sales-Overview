# Lamba Zambia Sales Analysis

### Overview:
The marketing team is seeking ways to leverage data from the daily sales reports to predict future sales trends and identify factors influencing current sales.
Due to confidentiality, some details from the daily sales reports have been excluded from this project. Lamba Zambia Limited operates multiple franchises in Zambia and owns its own brands, including Bo’jangles Restaurant, Qube Night Club, and The Great Escape (a venue for both kids and adults). All four stores are located in Lusaka by Longacres or at KK Mall. Each store accepts three payment methods: cash, credit cards, and Tingg. Additionally, Bo’jangles and The Great Escape provide options for advance bookings or reservations.

### Data Source:
This project utilized daily sales reports from Lamba Zambia Limited for Bo’jangles Restaurant, Qube Night Club, and The Great Escape. The data presented an opportunity for in-depth analysis, making this both an engaging and valuable learning experience.

### Objectives:
•	Extract relevant data from the daily sales reports. </br>
•	Clean and prepare the data for analysis. </br>
•	Develop an interactive dashboard for data visualization.

### Tools Used:

•	Microsoft Excel </br>
•	Tableau Public

### Data Cleaning and Preparation:

•	Collected necessary data from daily sales reports and balancing sheets. </br>
•	Transferred the data to an Excel balance sheet. </br>
•	Removed irrelevant columns and other unnecessary data. </br>
•	Saved the cleaned file as a CSV for analysis.

### Data Exploration:
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) aimed to answer key questions, including:

•	Gross sales across the four stores for all four quarters. </br>
•	Total credit card transactions handled by cashiers. </br>
•	Average Tingg transactions per cashier. </br>
•	Total advance bookings at Bo’jangles and The Great Escape. </br>
•	Breakdown of payment methods and advance bookings by cashier.

The CSV file was imported into Tableau for visualization. After verifying the data source in Tableau, individual visualizations were created and compiled into a final interactive dashboard.

### Key Insights:
1.	Quarterly and Monthly Sales Trends:
 - The highest sales occurred in Q3 of 2024, particularly in August. This surge was driven by multiple jazz music events hosted at Bo’jangles Restaurant.
 - Among the four stores, Bo’jangles generated the highest revenue, while Qube Night Club and The Great Escape lagged behind.
 - The lowest sales were recorded in Q4 of 2024, especially in November. This decline was attributed to Qube Night Club's decision to eliminate cash payments in favor of digital cards, which alienated many customers who preferred cash.
2.	Performance by Cashier:
 - Tendai emerged as the top-performing cashier, recording the highest sales consistently from Q1 to Q4. Recognizing her exceptional performance with an "Employee of the Month" award could serve as a motivation and set a positive example for others.
This analysis highlights actionable insights and underscores the importance of data-driven decision-making in optimizing sales strategies and enhancing customer satisfaction.
